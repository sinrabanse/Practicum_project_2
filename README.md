# Practicum_project_2
My second project from Practicum course

What was used in the project: Python, Jupyter notebook. Libraries: pandas, nltk.

Project Description

This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. I’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

My report will be assumed when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

# Steps
1) Preprocess the data.
2) Answer these questions:
   - Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
   - Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
   - Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
   - How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?
3) Overall conclusion.

# Description of the data
